# Exonaut: Exploring Exoplanets for Young Minds

Welcome to the Exonaut project repository! We're a team participating in the HackYeah hackathon, and we're on a mission to make learning about exoplanets fun and engaging for kids.

## Deployed on:

[ExoNaut](https://exonaut.vercel.app/)

## About the Project

Exonaut is an interactive educational app designed to introduce young children to the fascinating world of exoplanets. Built using Next.js, our goal is to spark curiosity about space exploration and make complex astronomical concepts accessible to young learners.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Exonaut project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

Happy coding and exploring exoplanets!

## Technicalities

- NextJS
- TailwindCSS

- Vercel

## Logic
Exobucks calculation is done after each learning you get +5 and at the end there is a quiz and you get 1 if you pass it too
